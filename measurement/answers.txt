2)    Predicted throughput: min (18.8, 38.1, 23.8, 23.7) = 18.8 Mbps
      Predicted RTT: 81.146 + 21.390 + 10.993 + 10.885 = 124.41 ms
      Actual throughput: 18.7 Mbps
      Actual RTT: 123.927 ms
      Explanation of results: As expected, the predicted and actual results are very close. Throughput is limited by the link with the lowest throughput and RTT is expected to be close to the sum of the RTTs of the individual link RTTs. The 
      data may differ more from expected results if this wasn't using Mininet. 

3.1)  Predicted throughput: (9.4 Mbps, 9.4 Mbps)
      Predicted RTT: (124 ms, 124 ms)
      Actual throughput: (12.7 Mbps, 6.49 Mbps)
      Actual RTT: (123.055 ms, 123.055 ms)
      Explanation of results: 
      The throughput is limited by the 18.8 Mbps bottleneck so it's expected that the two throughputs sum up to about that value. 
      The uneven distribution of throughput might be due to uneven start times but their sum is equal to the bottleneck. 
      The RTTs remained near the base RTT because of small queuing delay in this system. 

3.2)  Predicted throughput: (12 Mbps, 4.5 Mbps, 1.5 Mbps)
      Predicted RTT: (124 ms, 124 ms, 124 ms)
      Actual throughput: (11.6 Mbps, 4.64 Mbps, 3.46 Mbps)
      Actual RTT: (123.044 ms, 123.558 ms, 125.044 ms)
      Explanation of results: 
      The throughput once again wasn't distributed evenly but we still see that their sum is roughly equal to the bottleneck throughput.
      And the RTTs once again remained about the same due to small queuing delay and measurement overlap. 

4)    Predicted throughput: (h1-h10: 12 Mbps, h3-h8: 12 Mbps)
      Predicted RTT: (h1-h10: 124 ms, h3-h8: 32 ms) 
      Actual throughput: (h1-h10: 14.3 Mbps, h3-h8: 10.0 Mbps)
      Actual RTT: (h1-h10: 122.612 ms, h3-h8: 31.044 ms)
      Explanation of results: 
      The new bottleneck here for the two data paths is now about 24 and as expected, the sum of the two throughputs is roughly 24 Mbps.
      The RTTs for h1-h10 and h3-h8 are much different now because of the difference in path lengths. The disparity is expected and 
      reflects the timing of their base paths.
